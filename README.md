This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a pizza store's sales performance using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for interactive visualization. The objective was to analyze key business metrics, identify sales trends, and provide data-driven recommendations to improve business performance.

## Key Objectives
KPI Analysis: Calculate Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizzas Sold, Total Orders, and Average Pizzas per Order.
Trend Identification: Analyze Daily and Monthly trends for Total Orders to pinpoint peak business hours/periods.
Product Performance: Evaluate sales by Pizza Category and Size to understand customer preferences.
Inventory Insights: Identify the Top 5 and Bottom 5 Best/Worst Sellers based on Revenue, Quantity, and Total Orders.

## Tech Stack
Database: SQL (MS SQL Server)
Visualization: Power BI Desktop
Data Processing: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) & Power Query
Documentation: Microsoft Excel / GitHub

## Data Analysis Workflow
SQL Querying: Used SQL to write complex queries and validate the raw data against the dashboard's KPIs. (Scripts included in the repository).
Data Cleaning: Used Power Query to handle null values, format date columns, and ensure data consistency.
Data Modeling: Established relationships between tables for efficient filtering and calculation.
DAX Calculations: Created custom measures for dynamic values like "Average Pizzas per Order."
Dashboard Design: Built a 2-page interactive dashboard focusing on Sales Overview and Product Performance.

## Insights & Recommendations
Peak Periods: Orders are highest on Fridays and Saturdays, particularly during evening hours.
Top Sellers: The Classic category contributes the most to total sales and volume.
Underperformers: Identified specific pizzas with low order volume, suggesting a need for promotional offers or menu adjustments.
